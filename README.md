# Disaster Response Pipeline Project 

## Introduction
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in collaboration with [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/).

In this project, the pre-labeled disaster messages will be used to build a disaster response model that can categorize messages received in real time during a disaster event, so that messages can be sent to the right disaster response agency.

This project includes a web application where disaster response worker can input messages received and get classification results.

## File Descriptions
### Folder: app
**run.py** - python script to launch web application.<br/>
Folder: templates - web dependency files (go.html & master.html) required to run the web application.

### Folder: data
**disaster_messages.csv** - real messages sent during disaster events (provided by Figure Eight)<br/>
**disaster_categories.csv** - categories of the messages<br/>
**process_data.py** - ETL pipeline used to load, clean, extract feature and store data in SQLite database<br/>
**ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook used to prepare ETL pipeline<br/>
**DisasterResponse.db** - cleaned data stored in SQlite database

### Folder: models
**train_classifier.py** - ML pipeline used to load cleaned data, train model and save trained model as pickle (.pkl) file for later use<br/>
**classifier.pkl** - pickle file contains trained model<br/>
**ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook used to prepare ML pipeline

## Libraries
Install packages via pip install:

- sys
- os
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- sklearn
- sqlalchemy
- re
- pickle

- nltk.download('punkt')
- nltk.download('wordnet')

## Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
